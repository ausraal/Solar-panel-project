# Solar-panel-project
Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a working simple website for a small solar panel installation business (all text in Lithuanian language).
Not yet uploaded to the server.
Made with Bootstrap, some JavaScript and some PHP for a contact form to get working.
Features
Nice looking, simple to use, fully responsive web page with interactive contact form enabling users to choose energy usage amount instead of simply entering number. I have used JavaScript slider for this. Project has some basic information about solar energy (advantages, disadvantages), contact form, about us page with interactive cards and a shared nav bar. PHP part of the form has validation and sanitation of user input but sends it directly as the email to page owner instaed of saving it to any database.
Setup & Installation
In order to see and use a code you only need some code editor to be installed like Visual Studio Code. If you want to test how the form is working a server is also needed for a php part.
